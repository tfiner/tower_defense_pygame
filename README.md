tower_defense_pygame
====================

This is a prototype that shows off the A* path finding algorithm.  I wrote it a few 
years ago and I haven't upgraded or played with it in a long time.  This project is 
disorganized and the assets and the code are sprinkled throughout.  

Dependencies
* PyGame
* libSDL
* Python

Running it:
./tower_defense.py

Left click to set a new "tower" down.
Space bar to add a new creeper (add lots of them and rapidly click)
tab to select a tower (you'll need to comment out the heat map to see the tower selection)
u to upgrade a tower (the range increases, and I think the power might too).

By default, the map is drawing a heat map that the creeper avoids.
